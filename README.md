# A Spiking Neural Model of Decision Making and the Speed-Accuracy Tradeoff

## Installation
 > pip install numpy scipy matplotlib seaborn pandas jupyter nengo nni
 
## Code
 - **model.ipynb** contains code for simulating individual trials and plotting dynamics
 - **analysis.ipynb** contains code for simulating many trials, for running multiple experiments with different parameters, and for plotting comparisons to the empirical data
 - **nni/compare_mechanisms.py** contains the core optimization code for fitting model parameters to the human data
 - **nni/experiment.py** is the wrapper code for starting multiple nni experiments simultaneously: edit the file to specify the hyperparameters, then run ```python experiment.py```
 - **nni/collect.py** is used to collect the data generated by running experiment.py, once all nni experiments are complete. Just run ```python collect.py```, which will spit out a .json file that contains the best-fit parameters for each individual. Then use analysis.ipynb to simulate the plot the results.
